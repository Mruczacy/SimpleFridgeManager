# SimpleFridgeManager
## Idea and purpose
This is the fridge content list. The idea came up when I realised that I waste so many food, also I wanted to train my skills in Laravel and PHP. This app solves problem of people that wastes so many food, because they are so lazy that it isn't even worth to have a look into theirs own fridges. Basicly it should be used as fridge manager that should indicate if products that we bought are still edible or to avoid going rotten As of May 2022 there is no live version of this application, but if I will have a little of free time to do that the app will be finished (including missing frontend), deployed and available to everyone. Also if you are interested in contributing to this project please feel free to do that.
