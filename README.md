# SimpleFridgeManager
## Idea and purpose
This is the fridge content list. The idea came up when I realised that I waste so many food, also that time I wanted to train my skills in Laravel and PHP. This app should solve our personal problems of wasting food, because sometimes we are so lazy that it isn't even worth to have a look into our own fridges. Basicly it should be used as fridge manager that should indicate if products that we have bought are still edible or it may have rotten. As of May 2022 there is no live version of this application. However, if I will have a little of free time to do that the app will be finished (including missing frontend and other languages support), deployed and available to everyone. Also if you are interested in contributing to this project please feel free to do that.
